## Managing Sessions

### Viewing Sessions

All sessions are stored in the `sessions/` folder. Each session has its own subfolder with authentication credentials.

### Deleting a Session

To delete a specific session, simply delete its folder:

**Windows:**
```cmd
rmdir /s /q sessions\session_name
```

**Or manually:**
Navigate to the `sessions/` folder and delete the unwanted session folder.

### Starting Fresh

To clear all sessions and start fresh:

```bash
pnpm clean
```

Note: This will delete the old `auth_info_baileys` folder if it exists (from older versions).


## Dependencies

- `@whiskeysockets/baileys` - WhatsApp Web API
- `qrcode-terminal` - QR code generation for terminal
- `pino` - Logger
- `dotenv` - Environment variable management

## Troubleshooting
**If still getting errors:**
- Delete the session folder: `rmdir /s /q sessions\session_name`
- Reconnect with fresh QR/pairing code
- Check Windows system time: `w32tm /resync` in CMD
- Make sure welcome message is disabled

**General connection issues:**
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure WhatsApp Web is not open in your browser (only one connection allowed)
- Try deleting the session folder and reconnecting

**Pairing code not working:**
- Ensure phone number is in correct format (country code without + or spaces)
- Example: For +1 234-567-8900, enter: `12345678900`
- Make sure you're entering the code in WhatsApp within the time limit (usually 1-2 minutes)

**Bot not responding to commands:**
- ✅ Fixed! The bot now uses a universal message extractor
- Handles all WhatsApp message types (conversation, extended, ephemeral, captions, etc.)
- Make sure you're using the correct prefix (default is `.`)
- Commands must start with prefix: `.menu` not just `menu`
- Check console logs - you should see: `⚡ Executing command: .menu`
- If in private mode, ensure your number matches OWNER_NUMBER in .env

**Admin commands not working:**
- ✅ Fixed! Commands now check if USER is admin, not bot
- Unlike Telegram, WhatsApp doesn't have "bot admin" concept
- Bot owner (OWNER_NUMBER) can bypass all admin checks
- In public mode: group admins can use `.add`, `.kick`, `.promote`, `.demote`, `.mute`, `.unmute`
- In private mode: only bot owner can use commands

**Group commands (.mute, .unmute, .add, etc.) failing:**
- Make sure you're using these commands in a group chat
- Ensure you have admin permissions in the group (or you're the bot owner)
- Check that the bot is still connected (use `.ping` to test)

**Multiple sessions not working:**
- Make sure each session has a unique name
- Sessions are stored in the `sessions/` folder
- Each session can only be connected to one device at a time
